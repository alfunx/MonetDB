# Fix a .msi (Windows Installer) file for a 64-bit registry search.
# Microsoft refuses to fix a bug in Visual Studio so that for a 64-bit
# build, the registry search will look in the 32-bit part of the
# registry instead of the 64-bit part of the registry.  This script
# fixes the .msi to look in the correct part.
