The code in this directory is based on the unixODBC driver template
written by Peter Harvey (pharvey@codebydesign.com).  The unixODBC
driver template is part of the source distribution of unixODBC which
can be downloaded from http://www.unixODBC.org/.

The original code is licensed under the terms of the LGPL (GNU Library
General Public License, Version 2, June 1991), and therefore the code
in this directory is also licensed under the LPGL (see the file
COPYING in this directory), unlike the other directories in this
project which are under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

All original files have been modified, often heavily, and some have
been deleted since they were originally copied in June 2001.  The
original code was a template for an ODBC driver, whereas the current
code attempts to implement the ODBC driver for the SQL server which is
part of the MonetDB project.
