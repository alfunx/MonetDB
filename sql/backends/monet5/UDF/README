This directory is a template for extending SQL with a new user-defined
function (UDF).  For further documentation, see the MonetDB website at
http://www.monetdb.org/Documentation/Cookbooks/SQLrecipes/UserDefinedFunction
as well as the Mercurial repository at
http://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB-extend
and especially the file reverse/README.rst in there, which contains a
lot of hands-on information for creating a UDF.
