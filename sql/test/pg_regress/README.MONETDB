This directory contains regression tests copied from the PostgreSQL
source tree.

For now, it's just a manual job of selecting tests from them (in the sql
directory), convert them to something that works for us (in the monetdb
directory) and make a test for it.
Some of the tests require the data from the data directory to be loaded.
SQL scripts are supplied to load these.  For the onek and tenk
datafiles, the wisconsin load script in the wisconsin benchmark
directory should be loaded.
(ie. JdbcClient -f ../../benchmarks/wisconsin/load.sql -Xbatching 400)

postgresql2sql99.sh
	This script does an attempt to convert input in PostgreSQL syntax to
	SQL99 compatible syntax.  It is typically used to convert the files
	from the sql directory for use with MonetDB.
