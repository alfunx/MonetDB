				five front teeth missing (Rumbelow); two bottom-one top
				front (Fido), her teeth are slightly discoloured. She is
				described as having small, delicate features with high
				cheekbones and grey eyes. She has a small scar on her
				forehead from a childhood injury.  She is described by
				Emily Holland as "a very clean woman who always seemed
				to keep to herself." The doctor at the post mortem
				remarked on the cleanliness of her thighs.  She is also
				an alcoholic.

					<time>11:00 PM</time>
					Polly is seen walking down Whitechapel Road, she is
					probably soliciting trade.
				</event>
				<event>     
					<time>12:30 AM</time>
					She is seen leaving the Frying Pan Public House at
					the corner of Brick Lane and Thrawl Street. She
					returns to the lodging house at 18 Thrawl Street.
				</event> 
				<event>
					<time>1:20 or 1:40 AM</time>
					She is told by the deputy to leave the kitchen of
					the lodging house because she could not produce her
					doss money. Polly, on leaving, asks him to save a
					bed for her. "Never Mind!" She says, "I'll soon get
					my doss money. See what a jolly bonnet I've got
					now." She indicates a little black bonnet which no
					one had seen before.
				</event>
				<event> 
					<time>2:30 AM</time>
					She meets Emily Holland, who was returning from
					watching the Shadwell Dry Dock fire, outside of a
					grocer's shop on the corner of Whitechapel Road and
					Osborn Street. Polly had come down Osborn Street.
					Holland describes her as "very drunk and staggered
					against the wall." Holland calls attention to the
					church clock striking 2:30. Polly tells Emily that
					she had had her doss money three times that day and
					had drunk it away. She says she will return to
					Flower and Dean Street where she could share a bed
					with a man after one more attempt to find trade.
					"I've had my doss money three times today and spent
					it." She says, "It won't be long before I'm back."
					The two women talk for seven or eight minutes. Polly
					leaves walking east down Whitechapel Road.
					At the time, the services of a destitute prostitute
					like Polly Nichols could be had for 2 or 3 pence or
					a stale loaf of bread. 3 pence was the going rate as
					that was the price of a large glass of gin.
				</event>
				<event>  
					<time>3:15 AM</time>
					P.C. John Thain, 96J, passes down Buck's Row on his
					beat. He sees nothing unusual. At approximately the
					same time Sgt. Kerby passes down Bucks Row and
					reports the same.
				</event>
				<event>   
					<time>3:40 or 3:45 AM</time>
					Polly Nichols' body is discovered in Buck's Row by
					Charles Cross, a carman, on his way to work at
					Pickfords in the City Road., and Robert Paul who
					joins him at his request. "Come and look over here,
					there's a woman." Cross calls to Paul. Cross
					believes she is dead. Her hands and face are cold
					but the arms above the elbow and legs are still
					warm. Paul believes he feels a faint heartbeat. "I
					think she's breathing," he says "but it is little if
					she is."
